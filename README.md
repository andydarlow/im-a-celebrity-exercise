# im-a-celebrety-exercise (Clojure)

This is a simple excercise for a friend who was interested
in getting to grips with clojure (and coding generally). 
I gave him this simple exercise/possible answers here. So
he can get to learn some basic clojure. 

## The problem domain

I'm a celebrity is a tv show where celebs have to perform
tasks. At the end of each show a celebrity is voted off the show..

I'm a celebrity has a public vote on every episode
to evict a celebry from the show. The celeb with the 
lowest number of votes is evicted from the camp

The process repeates until only 2 celebs are left. This
is the final, In the final. The celeb with the highest
vote wins the competition

## Installation

Ensure that you have installed Lein. 

## Usage

Excercise runs in REPL

To run, do the following

lein test 

this will run the tests. You can see how tests are written in the test folder.
Tests are a simple way to prove that the code you're about to write will do what
you think and help you think about all the edge cases and what to do with them


## Excerise

The aim is to write a model of the eviction and then write functions to evaluate the data
and esablish who won the competition. 

You can cheat and look at the code but best to work through it and learn. 

Take a look at test/im_a_celebrity_excerise/test_data.clojure if your really stuck. 
It may give some some ideas on how to structure the data
